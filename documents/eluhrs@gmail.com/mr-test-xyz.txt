74\nPanama, Dec. 29. 1874\nMy dear Capt. Green,-\nYour favor by Dr. Boyd duly came.\nWe observed our latitude stars on Sunday night, and\nof course last night again. The instrument behaves well.\nYesterday morning (before your letter came) & this morn.\nwe observed for azimuth & variation. Though heavily on\nour minds we couldn't accomplish it earlier, while the\nlongitude work lasted. On Sat. night we observed 24 stars.\nI will enclose your signals. I think our work is a success.\nTo-day Mr. Spencer dismounts the telegraph line. We hope to\nun\ncome over on Sat. Morn. - I do not think the pier is steady,\nI think some one hit an arm of the instrument unconsciously\neach time I found it out of meridian.\nThe vernier trouble is due to that arm making an angle\nwith the vertical. I am convinced that most of the register\ntroubles are due to bad quality of the fillet paper. It is un=\nequal thickness at two edges and also varies in thickness\nlengthwise, so as to require frequent readjustment of\nrollers & stylet.\nVery truly Yrs.\nMiles Rock\n
