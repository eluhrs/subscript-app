Panama, Dec. 29. 1874
My dear Capt. Green,-
Your favor by Dr. Boyd duly came.
We observed our latitude stars on Sunday night, and
of course last night again. The instrument behaves well.
Yesterday morning (before your letter came) & this morn.
we observed for azimuth & variation. Though heavily on
our minds we couldn't accomplish it earlier, while the
longitude work lasted. On Sat. night we observed 24 stars.
I will enclose your signals. I think our work is a success.
To-day Mr. Spencer dismounts the telegraph line. We hope to
come over on Sat. Morn. - I do not think the pier is unsteady,
I think some one hit an arm of the instrument unconsciously
each time I found it out of meridian.
The vernier trouble is due to that arm making an angle
with the vertical. I am convinced that most of the register
troubles are due to bad quality of the fillet paper. It is un=
equal thickness at two edges and also varies in thickness
lengthwise, so as to require frequent readjustment of
rollers & stylet.
Very truly Yrs.
Miles Rock
