# Subscript HTR pipeline: image segmentation, transcription, and searchable PDF conversion

A flexible tool for transcribing images of handwritten manuscript into searchable PDFs using a combination of **Kraken** (for layout analysis), **LLMs** (for handwriting recognition), and **ReportLab** (for PDF generation).

This tool is designed to be accessible for Digital Humanities researchers while remaining hackable for developers.

## Features
-   **Hybrid Pipeline:** Uses Kraken's segmentation features to find lines of text, then send a numbered annotation map to a Generative AI model for high-accuracy transcription. Note that Kraken only works well with full-page images, not smaller fragments of paper.  Support for other segmentation providers may be added in the future.
-   **Batch Processing:** Handle single images or glob patterns (e.g., `filename??.jpg` or `*.jpg`).
-   **Combined Output:** Optionally combine multiple input images into a single PDF output file.
-   **Searchable PDF Output:** Generates PDFs in which the image is visible, but the text is and searchable and selectable (invisible text layer).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1.  **Python 3.10 or 3.11** (Recommended for Kraken compatibility).
    *   *Note: Newer versions of Python may have compatibility issues with some dependencies.*
2.  **API Key**: You will need an API key for any model provider you intend to use (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI, etc).

### Setup
1.  **Clone or Download** this repository.
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
    ```bash
    # macOS/Linux
    python3.10 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Configure Environment**:
    Create a `.env` file in the project root using the steps below (or rename the provided example.env to `.env`). In either case, you will also need to add your API key(s) to the file.
    ```bash
    # Create .env file
    echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
    echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env
### Option 1: Install as a Package (Recommended)
This allows you to run `subscript` from any directory.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eluhrs/subscript.git
cd subscript

# Install
pip install .

# Or install directly from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/eluhrs/subscript.git
```

### Option 2: Run Locally (Development)
You can run the script directly from the repository root without installing.

```bash
./subscript.py ...
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface
If installed, use the `subscript` command. If running locally, use `./subscript.py`.

**Note:** The tool operates relative to your **current working directory**. Input files, output directories, and `.env` files should be in the folder where you run the command.

```bash
# Basic usage
subscript [SEGMENTATION-MODEL] [TRANSCRIPTION-MODEL] [INPUT-FILE-OR-GLOB]
```
-   **SEGMENTATION-NICKNAME**: (Optional) The nickname of the segmentation model to use (defined in `config.yml`), e.g., `historical-manuscript`. If omitted, the segmentation model defined as default is used.
-   **MODEL-NICKNAME**: (Optional) The nickname of the transcription model to use (defined in `config.yml`), e.g., `gemini-flash`. If omitted, the transcription model defined as default is used.
-   **INPUT**: Path to an image or a wildcard pattern for multiple images

### Examples
**1. Transcribe a single image (using defaults):**
```bash
./subscript.py input/sample.jpg
```

**2. Transcribe using a specific transcription model:**
```bash
./subscript.py gemini-flash input/sample.jpg
```

**3. Transcribe using a specific segmentation model:**
```bash
./subscript.py historical-manuscript input/sample.jpg
```

**4. Transcribe using specific models for both:**
```bash
./subscript.py historical-manuscript gemini-flash input/sample.jpg
```

**5. Combine multiple images into one book:**
```bash
./subscript.py "input/*.jpg" --combine my_filename.pdf
```
*Output: `output/my_filename.pdf` and `output/my_filename.txt` (all pages)*

### Options
| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--help` | Show this help message and exit. |
| `--config` | Path to alternate config file (default: `./config.yml`). |
| `--output` | Path to alternate output directory (default: `./output`). |
| `--combine` | Combine multiple input images into specified PDF filename. |
| `--nopdf` | Create TXT and XML files, but skip PDF output. |
| `--prompt` | Override model prompt defined in `config.yml`. |
| `--temp` | Override temperature defined in `./config.yml`. |

## Configuration (config.yml)
The `config.yml` file defines the available models, segmentation providers, and their default settings.

```yaml
# --- Segmentation Analysis ---
segmentation:
  default_segmentation: "historical-manuscript"
  
  # Define available segmentation models (additional models to be added in the future)
  models:
    historical-manuscript:
      provider: "kraken"
      model: "default"

# --- Transcription ---
transcription:
  default_model: "gemini-pro-3"

  # Define available models here
  models:
    gemini-pro-3:
      provider: "gemini"
      model: "gemini-3-pro-preview"
      prompt: "You are a literal transcription engine..."
      cost_config:
        input_token_cost: 2.0
        output_token_cost: 12.0
      API_passthrough: # provide model-specific settings below
        temperature: 0.0
        max_output_tokens: 8192
```

## Web Application

Subscript includes a full-stack web application (React + FastAPI) for a graphical user interface.

### Running Locally (Docker)
Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

1.  **Start the Application**:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
2.  **Access the UI**:
    Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
3.  **API Documentation**:
    Open [http://localhost:8001/docs](http://localhost:8001/docs) to view the auto-generated API docs.

### Production Deployment
To deploy on a server (e.g., Debian/Ubuntu with Apache):

1.  **Run Docker**:
    Start the containers as shown above.
2.  **Configure Apache Reverse Proxy**:
    Enable proxy modules: `a2enmod proxy proxy_http`.
    Add a VirtualHost configuration:
    ```apache
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName subscript.yourdomain.com
        
        ProxyPreserveHost On
        ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
    </VirtualHost>
    ```
3.  **Restart Apache**: `systemctl restart apache2`.
